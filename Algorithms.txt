High Dimensional means that the number of dimensions are staggeringly high â€” so high that calculations become extremely difficult.
With high dimensional data, the number of features can exceed the number of observations. 

It can be said that bias is related with a model failing to fit the training set and variance is related with a model failing to fit the testing set.
